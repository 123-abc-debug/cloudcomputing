Lab 1:
1. Check if your processor supports Intel/AMD virtualization technology. Enable Intel virtualization technology in BIOS if possible.
To check support：
On Windows: Open "Task Manager" → Go to the "Performance" tab → Select "CPU" → Look for "Virtualization" (it will show "Enabled" or "Disabled" if supported; if not shown, the processor may not support it).
To enable in BIOS (general steps):
Restart the computer and press the BIOS key during boot (common keys: Del, F2, F10, F12; check the computer manufacturer’s guide for the exact key).
In the BIOS menu, find options like "Advanced" → "CPU Configuration" or "Virtualization Technology".
Set "Intel Virtualization Technology" (for Intel) or "AMD-V" (for AMD) to "Enabled".
Save changes (press F10 usually) and restart the computer.
2. The cloud is almost everywhere in our lives now. What do you think are the fundamental reasons behind its success? Name three pros and three cons of cloud.
（1）Fundamental reasons for success:
Cost optimization: Shifts IT spending from high upfront capital expenditure (CapEx) to flexible operating expenditure (OpEx), eliminating costs for hardware procurement, maintenance, and cooling.
Elasticity and scalability: Automatically adjusts computing resources (e.g., storage, processing power) based on real-time demand, avoiding resource waste or shortages.
Ubiquitous access: Allows users to access data and applications from any device (e.g., smartphones, laptops) and location via the internet, supporting remote work and mobile scenarios.
（2）Three pros of cloud:
Reduced IT management burden: Cloud providers handle infrastructure maintenance, software updates, and security patches, freeing users from technical operations.
Rapid deployment: New services or applications can be launched in minutes/hours (vs. weeks/months for on-premises setups), accelerating time-to-market.
Disaster recovery: Cloud providers offer redundant storage and backup solutions across geographically distributed data centers, improving data reliability and business continuity.
（3）Three cons of cloud:
Dependency on internet connectivity: Cloud services are unavailable if the internet connection is interrupted, affecting business operations.
Security and privacy risks: Data stored in the public cloud may face threats like unauthorized access, data breaches, or compliance issues with regional data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).
Vendor lock-in: Migrating data or applications between different cloud providers can be costly and complex due to incompatible APIs, formats, or service models.

3. What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?

The primary function of a hypervisor (also called a virtual machine monitor, VMM) is to create, manage, and isolate multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical host machine. It acts as an intermediary between the physical hardware (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) and the VMs, enabling:

Resource allocation: Dynamically distributing physical hardware resources (e.g., CPU cores, RAM, disk space) to each VM based on predefined settings.
Isolation: Ensuring VMs run independently—one VM’s failures, crashes, or security issues do not affect other VMs or the host operating system.
Hardware abstraction: Hiding the complexity of physical hardware from VMs, allowing VMs to run different guest operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux) regardless of the host’s OS.
  

4. What is a virtual machine (VM)?
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an independent operating system (called the guest OS) and applications, just like a physical machine. It leverages virtualization technology (managed by a hypervisor) to share the physical hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) of a host machine, while maintaining logical isolation from other VMs and the host system. A VM contains all components required for a physical computer, including a virtual CPU, virtual memory, virtual storage (e.g., virtual disks), and virtual network interfaces. Multiple VMs can run simultaneously on a single physical host, each operating as a separate "computer" with its own software environment.

5. What are the benefits of using virtual machines?
Resource efficiency: Multiple VMs share a single physical host’s resources, reducing the number of physical servers needed and lowering costs for hardware, power, and data center space.
Isolation and security: Each VM operates in a separate environment—malware or errors in one VM cannot spread to others, enhancing system stability and data security.
Flexible testing and development: Developers can create VMs with different OS versions or configurations to test applications without affecting the host system, accelerating testing cycles.
Easy backup and recovery: VMs can be saved as portable virtual disk files (e.g., VMDK, VHD), enabling quick backups, clones, or restorations to previous states.
Legacy application support: Old applications that require outdated OS versions (e.g., Windows XP) can run in VMs, avoiding compatibility issues with modern host operating systems.
6. List five use cases of virtual machines.
Software development and testing: Developers use VMs to simulate different operating systems (e.g., Windows 10, Ubuntu) or network environments, testing application compatibility without modifying the host system.
Server consolidation: Enterprises replace multiple physical servers (each running a single service, e.g., web server, database server) with VMs on a few physical hosts, reducing hardware costs and management complexity.
Education and training: Training institutions deploy VMs with preconfigured software (e.g., programming tools, network simulators) for students, ensuring a consistent learning environment and preventing accidental host system damage.
Cloud computing services: Cloud providers (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs) use VMs to deliver Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), allowing users to rent virtual servers on-demand.
Legacy system migration: Organizations run outdated business applications (e.g., old accounting software) in VMs, avoiding the need to maintain obsolete physical hardware while ensuring business continuity.
7. In virtualization, what is the guest operating system?
a) The main operating system running on the physical machine
b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine
c) The operating system running on a remote server
d) The operating system running on a mobile device

The correct answer is b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine.
8. What does virtual machine isolation mean?
a) Virtual machines can communicate directly with the physical hardware.
b) Virtual machines share the same resources and cannot be isolated.
c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.
d) Virtual machines can only be accessed locally.

The correct answer is c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.
9. What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?
a) It allows virtual machines to communicate with each other easily.
b) It ensures faster boot times for virtual machines.
c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.
d) It reduces the need for hardware virtualization.
The correct answer is c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.
10. What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?
The purpose of cloning a virtual machine is to create an exact, ready-to-use copy (clone) of an existing VM, including its operating system, applications, configurations, and data. This avoids the time-consuming process of manually installing and configuring a new VM from scratch. Common use cases include:

Rapid deployment: Cloning VMs with preconfigured software (e.g., web servers, database clients) to quickly scale up services.
Testing and debugging: Using clones to test software updates, patches, or new features without risking the original VM’s stability.
Disaster recovery: Keeping cloned VMs as backups—if the original VM fails, the clone can be activated immediately to restore services.
Consistent environments: Ensuring all team members (e.g., developers, testers) use identical VM environments, eliminating "it works on my machine" issues.
