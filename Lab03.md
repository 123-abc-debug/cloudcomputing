Dear Professor Shi Lei,

I hope this message finds you well.

Regarding the Lab03 assignment for GitHub Pages, I submitted a website project that was originally created for my family. Since this site was initially designed for personal use, its content and design are more tailored to family purposes and do not fully meet the professional introduction requirements of the assignment. Furthermore, the layout was optimized for mobile browsing, and as a result, the desktop version has some imperfections. I hope for your understanding in this matter.

My GitHub website address is: [https://123-abc-debug.github.io/](https://123-abc-debug.github.io/)

Thank you very much for your understanding.

Best regards,  
Yin Yuang
